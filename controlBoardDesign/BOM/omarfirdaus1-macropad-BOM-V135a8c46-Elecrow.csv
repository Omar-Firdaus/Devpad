"U1","102010428","1","","The Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 is as small as the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 but it's more powerful. On one hand, it carries the powerful Dual-core RP2040 processor that can flexible clock running up to 133 MHz which is a low-power microcontrollers. On the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 there is also 264KB of SRAM, and 2MB of on-board Flash memory which can provide more program to save and run. On the other hand, this little board has good performance in processing but needs less power.
All in all, it is designed in a tiny size as small as a thumb(20x17.5mm) and can be used for wearable devices and small projects. #RP2040 #PICO #XIAO #SeedStudio",""
